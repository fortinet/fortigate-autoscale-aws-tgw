# FortiGate Autoscale with AWS Transit Gateway Integration

FortiGate Autoscale is collection of **Node.js** modules and cloud-specific templates which support autoscale functionality for groups of FortiGate-VM instances on various cloud platforms.

AWS Transit Gateway can be used to connect Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and their on-premises networks to a single gateway. FortiGate Autoscale with Transit Gateway integration extends the protection to all networks connected to the Transit Gateway.

This project contains the code and templates for the deployment of FortiGate Autoscale on AWS with Transit Gateway integration.

For autoscale on Azure and on AWS without Transit Gateway integration, see the main [fortigate-autoscale](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale/) repository. For autoscale on AliCloud see the [alicloud-autoscale](https://github.com/fortinet/alicloud-autoscale/) repository.
